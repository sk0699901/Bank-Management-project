# Bank-Management-project
This is a beginner-friendly, file-based Bank Management System built in Python with a web interface using Streamlit. It allows users to create accounts, deposit/withdraw money, view/update details, and delete accounts. All data is stored in a JSON file (data.json), simulating a basic database.
